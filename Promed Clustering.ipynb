When it was only lat long the values were in similar ranges (-90 -> 90 and -180 -> 180) but with the timestamp values are much larger (ex: `9433152000`) which makes me thing that you will never get two timestamps in the same neighborhood if you have and eps value of, say, 2.  If I begin dividing the timestamp value by 10,000,000 it goes into a similar range for lat/long - is this something I should consider doing?\n",
